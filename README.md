# Flatdango Movie Theater

Flatdango is an online movie ticket booking application that allows users to view movie details, check showtimes, and purchase tickets for their favorite movies. This project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and utilizes a local JSON server to fetch movie data.

## Project Overview

The Flatdango Movie Theater project consists of the following key features:

- **View Movie List**: Users can see a list of available movies on the left side of the page.
- **Movie Details**: When the page loads, users can view details of the first movie in the list, including its poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets.
- **Buy Tickets**: Users can purchase tickets for a movie by clicking the "Buy Ticket" button. The number of available tickets decreases, and when no tickets are left, the button changes to "Sold Out."
